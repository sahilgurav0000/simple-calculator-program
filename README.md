# Simple Calculator Program

This is a basic Python program that performs simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 
It takes two user inputs as numbers and allows the user to select an operation to perform on these numbers.

## Features
- Accepts two numerical inputs from the user.
- Provides a menu to select one of the following operations:
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
- Displays the result of the chosen operation.
- Handles invalid operation inputs gracefully.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python interpreter.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Choose the operation by entering the corresponding number from the menu:
   - `1` for Addition
   - `2` for Subtraction
   - `3` for Multiplication
   - `4` for Division
5. The program will display the result of the selected operation.
6. If an invalid input is provided for the operation, the program will notify the user.

### Example
#### Input:
```
Enter the first number:- 10
Enter the second number:- 5

                   Choose operation

                   1.Addition
                   2.Subtraction
                   3.Multiplication
                   4.Division

Enter the operation number :-  1
```
#### Output:
```
You choose addition operation

Addition of 10 AND 5 is :- 15

## Notes
- Make sure to enter valid integers as input.
- For division, the second number should not be `0`, as it will raise a runtime error.
